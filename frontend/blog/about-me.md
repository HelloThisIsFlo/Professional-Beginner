title: "About Me"
---
My name is **Flo**, and I am the **Professional Beginner**.  
I apply the _"Beginner's Mind"_ to the world of Software and share on this blog what I learn
throughout my Journey.  
My focus is on **Software Crafting**. That is an emphasis on **readable code**, made reliable by
**tests**, and a desire to collaborate with those who love to **learn**, and **share** teachings of
their own.
