## Professional Beginner

Being a **Professional Beginner** is all about being comfortable with the vulnerability associated
with... _not knowing_. By embracing the vulnerability instead of rejecting it, it allows us to be
more honest and clear-minded on what these unknowns, that sometimes terrify us, really are. Then, it
is all about moving forward, learn what there is to learn, and... repeat.

Often it comes in the form of asking questions, even those to which it feels we _"should"_ know the
answer. Asking questions, but also not having too many expectations on the response. Ideally none,
realistically... some. While the name doesn't originate from there, it is very similar in form and
meaning to the _["Beginner's Mind"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin)_ of Zen Buddhism.

From this practice, a couple of truth emerged:

- Everything is complex before it becomes simple
- Nothing needs to **remain** complex
- The only requirement is the willingness to explore

For me, being a **Professional Beginner** isn't only a way to approach software, it is a way
of life.

My name is **Flo** and I am the **Professional Beginner**.
